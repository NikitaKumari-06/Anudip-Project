
The program follows a procedural programming approach, where the logic is organized into functions and executed in a linear manner. Each option selected by the user invokes the corresponding function to input and store the relevant information.

Please note that this code is a basic example and lacks error handling, input validation, and proper separation of concerns. In a real-world application, you would need to handle potential issues such as buffer overflows, incorrect input types, and more robust program structure.
